                    today we were watching snowfall (season 6, episode 6, 6:18-6:40) i dedicated what V said to franklin to you: "He's not a monster, not to me. to me, he is a man who hasn't lied, or raised a hand. He's the first person to ever put me first. he's doing everything in his power to deliver the life i want, no matter how he has to do it."<br>
                i wrote this after we watched this episode, and now i wanted to show you and tell you how i feel
